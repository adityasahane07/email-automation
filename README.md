# email-automation

This Python script uses the smtplib library to send an email with an attachment. It connects to Gmail's SMTP server, authenticates with sender credentials, attaches a file (abc.txt), and sends the email to a specified recipient. The script demonstrates basic email automation capabilities in Python.
